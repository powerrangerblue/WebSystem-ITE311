  - `GET /course/enrollments` - Get user enrollments
  - `GET /course/(:num)` - View course details
  - `GET /courses` - List all courses

### Step 7: Application Testing
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Test Results**:
  - All models instantiate successfully
  - 6 courses available in database
  - 3 users available for testing
  - Enrollment functionality working correctly

- **File**: `SECURITY_TESTING.md`
- **Security Measures Implemented**:
  - ✅ Authorization bypass protection
  - ✅ SQL injection prevention
  - ✅ CSRF protection
  - ✅ Data tampering prevention
  - ✅ Input validation
  - ✅ Duplicate enrollment prevention

## 🔧 Additional Components Created

### Course Model
- **File**: `app/Models/CourseModel.php`
- **Purpose**: Manages course data and provides methods for available courses

### Course Seeder
- **File**: `app/Database/Seeds/CourseSeeder.php`
- **Purpose**: Populates database with sample course data

### Test Command
- **File**: `app/Commands/TestEnrollment.php`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of enrollment system functionality

### Template Updates
- **File**: `app/Views/template.php`
- **Updates**: Added scripts section for JavaScript functionality

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- User must be logged in to access enrollment endpoint
- Session-based user identification (not client-supplied)
- Role-based access control

### 2. CSRF Protection
- CSRF tokens required for all POST requests
- Token validation on server-side
- Automatic token generation and validation

### 3. Input Validation
- Course ID format validation (numeric)
- Required field validation
- Course existence validation
- Duplicate enrollment prevention

### 4. SQL Injection Prevention
- CodeIgniter's built-in query builder with parameter binding
- Input sanitization and validation
- No direct SQL queries with user input

### 5. XSS Prevention
- Output escaping using `esc()` function
- Proper content type headers for JSON responses

## 🎯 Key Features

### User Experience
- **Real-time Enrollment**: No page reload required
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinners and success messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear separation of enrolled vs available courses

### Technical Features
- **AJAX Integration**: Seamless user experience
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages
- **Data Validation**: Server-side and client-side validation
- **Security**: Multiple layers of protection
